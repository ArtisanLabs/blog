## A multi-lingual system for real-time communication

Language is still a significant barrier for civilization, today we’re announcing a toolset we believe will help us all tackle this challenge.

It may not be obvious for everyone. If you’ve had the privilege to work and interact with others in your mother tongue, you may not fully grasp the dimension of this challenge.

However, everyday, millions of people wake up to show up to a job where many of their colleagues speak languages they can’t fully understand. This creates two kinds of citizens, those at the top, and those at the bottom.

For example, think about the cooks, cleaners, and maintenance latinos who struggle with English as their second language. This is just one of hundreds of possible cases where communication ends up being a challenge.

This is why, as part of the research work we’re doing at Artisan Labs, we’ve prioritized developing a multi-lingual core engine that can instantaneously identify when the user is struggling to understand concepts in a given language and switch the conversation over to their mother tongue.

The interface activates seamlessly, focusing on a very swift, and automated, transition between languages. There’s virtually no limit to the languages available, virtually no challenge to interact with the solution, even for the non-digital natives.

As we develop new functionalities and experiments that focus on enhancing the productivity of large scale teams that are underserved by the existing solutions, we double down on our commitment to build solutions that leverage artificial intelligence as a vehicle to improve human interactions, and facilitate accessibility for all.

Here’s a quick Demo on how it works. Let us know what do you think!
